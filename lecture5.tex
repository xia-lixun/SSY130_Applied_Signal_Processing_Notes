\chapter*{Lecture 5}
In this chapter, we introduce some alternative FIR filter design methods,
as well as IIR design method. 

In the beginning, let's recall the window method discussed in previous lecture.
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] Select cut-off frequency $\omega_c$
\item[(1)] Select model order N
\item[(1)] Select window function
\end{itemize}
In Matlab, function "fir1()" may help finish the design procedure with given 
parameters. For more information please refer to related help files.

\textbf{Frequency sampling method}
Decide $H(k)$, samples of desired DTFT $H(\omega)$, then use IDFT,
we have $h(n)$, which is multiplied by the window function $w(n)$,
resulting in $h'(n)=w(n)h(n)$. In matlab the corresponding function 
is "fir2()".
